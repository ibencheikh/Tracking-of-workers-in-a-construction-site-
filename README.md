# Tracking-of-workers-in-a-construction-site-
This is a camera-based worker tracker using YOLO-based detection algorithms for pedestrian tracking, designed for subsequent simulation purposes.

The code produces a csv file with the detected xy coordinates, and a video with the corresponding bounding boxes tracked.

This would return the list of tracks. In order to see the whole trajectory.
